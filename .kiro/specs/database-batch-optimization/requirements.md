# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical performance bottleneck in media file database operations where individual file insertions create excessive transaction overhead. Currently, the system processes 10,000 files in 5-6 seconds due to individual database transactions for each file. This optimization will implement batch processing to dramatically reduce database I/O overhead and achieve near-optimal insertion performance for large media libraries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Batch Media File Insertion

**User Story:** As a user with a large media collection, I want the initial media scan to complete quickly so that I can start using the DLNA server without waiting for extended processing times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN media files are scanned THEN the system SHALL collect files into batches before database insertion instead of inserting individually
2. WHEN batch insertion is performed THEN the system SHALL use a single database transaction for the entire batch instead of individual transactions per file
3. WHEN duplicate files are encountered during batch insertion THEN the system SHALL use upsert operations (INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE) to handle conflicts efficiently
4. WHEN a batch insertion fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information about which files in the batch caused the failure
5. WHEN processing 10,000 files THEN the insertion time SHALL be reduced from 5-6 seconds to under 1 second

### Requirement 2: Configurable Batch Sizing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure batch sizes based on system resources so that the database operations are optimized for my specific hardware and memory constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing is configured THEN the system SHALL allow customizable batch sizes through configuration settings
2. WHEN memory constraints are limited THEN smaller batch sizes SHALL be supported to prevent memory exhaustion
3. WHEN high-performance systems are used THEN larger batch sizes SHALL be supported to maximize throughput
4. WHEN batch size is not specified THEN the system SHALL use a sensible default (e.g., 1000 files per batch)
5. WHEN batch size exceeds database parameter limits THEN the system SHALL automatically split into smaller sub-batches

### Requirement 3: Batch Media File Removal

**User Story:** As a user managing a dynamic media library, I want file deletions to be processed efficiently so that cleanup operations don't cause system slowdowns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple files need to be removed THEN the system SHALL batch deletion operations instead of individual DELETE statements
2. WHEN batch deletion is performed THEN the system SHALL use IN clauses or temporary tables for efficient bulk removal
3. WHEN directory cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL identify all affected files in a single query before batch deletion
4. WHEN batch deletion fails THEN the system SHALL provide information about which files could not be removed
5. WHEN processing large deletion sets THEN memory usage SHALL remain bounded regardless of the number of files to delete

### Requirement 4: Transaction Management and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want robust transaction handling so that batch operations maintain data consistency even when partial failures occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch operations are performed THEN each batch SHALL be wrapped in a single database transaction
2. WHEN a batch operation fails THEN the entire batch SHALL be rolled back to maintain consistency
3. WHEN transaction rollback occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN database connection issues occur during batch operations THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN batch operations succeed THEN the transaction SHALL be committed atomically

### Requirement 5: Progress Reporting and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user processing large media libraries, I want to see progress updates during batch operations so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing is active THEN the system SHALL report progress at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 batches)
2. WHEN progress is reported THEN it SHALL include the number of files processed, total files, and estimated time remaining
3. WHEN batch operations complete THEN the system SHALL log summary statistics including total time, files processed, and average throughput
4. WHEN errors occur during batch processing THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting
5. WHEN debug logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed timing information for each batch operation

### Requirement 6: Memory Efficiency

**User Story:** As a user with limited system resources, I want batch processing to use memory efficiently so that the system remains stable even when processing very large media libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are collected for batching THEN the system SHALL limit in-memory file metadata to essential fields only
2. WHEN batch processing occurs THEN memory usage SHALL not grow linearly with the total number of files in the library
3. WHEN large batches are processed THEN the system SHALL stream data to the database instead of loading entire batches into memory
4. WHEN batch operations complete THEN temporary memory allocations SHALL be released promptly
5. WHEN processing libraries with 100,000+ files THEN peak memory usage SHALL remain under 100MB for batch operations

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user of the media server, I want the batch optimization to work seamlessly with my current setup so that I don't need to reconfigure or migrate my database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the batch optimization is deployed THEN existing database schemas SHALL continue to work without migration
2. WHEN batch operations are used THEN they SHALL produce identical database state as individual operations
3. WHEN the system falls back to individual operations THEN it SHALL do so gracefully without data loss
4. WHEN configuration is missing batch settings THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and continue operating
5. WHEN older database versions are encountered THEN the system SHALL detect capabilities and adjust batch strategies accordingly

### Requirement 8: Performance Benchmarking

**User Story:** As a developer optimizing the system, I want comprehensive performance metrics so that I can validate the effectiveness of batch processing and identify further optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing is implemented THEN the system SHALL include benchmarking tools to measure insertion performance
2. WHEN performance tests are run THEN they SHALL compare batch vs individual operation performance across different dataset sizes
3. WHEN benchmarks are executed THEN they SHALL measure both throughput (files/second) and latency (time per batch)
4. WHEN performance regression occurs THEN benchmarks SHALL detect and report the degradation
5. WHEN optimization targets are set THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 10x performance improvement over individual operations for large datasets
